How to get repository running

As long as you have mongodb running this code will run

Clone it 
cd testapp
node app.js

Hit localhost:2010/contacts with a browser
Add a record and see if sort works - it doesn't

The two important files are
views/layout.jade
views/contact/index.jade

Based on those hopefully it will look familar enough to get working even without knowing jade
It might be something as simple as the proper indenting of });

I fell that I am really close. If you help me get this working I promise to document a working 
example of jade for your website.
